chrissi's Zoom is a lightweight client-side utility mod that allows you to zoom in by holding a keybind.

Uses Minecraft's built-in spyglass zoom functionality for smooth, vanilla-like zooming; all in a very lightweight way.

<summary>How to Use</summary>

Hold **C** (default keybind) to zoom in. While zooming, use your **mouse wheel** to adjust the zoom level.

To change the keybind, go to **Options → Controls → Miscellaneous** and look for "Hold Zoom".

You can customize the mod's behavior by editing the config file located at:

```
config/chrissi-zoom.json
```

**Note:** You need to restart Minecraft after changing the config file for changes to take effect.

**Mod Menu integration** may be considered for future updates, but for now, manual config editing keeps the mod lightweight and dependency-free.
