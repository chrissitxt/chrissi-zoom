chrissi's Night Vision is a lightweight client-side mod that allows you to toggle the night vision effect with a keybind.

Gives you Minecraft's built-in night vision instead of just boosting brightness, so you keep the original lighting and full shader support; all in a very lightweight way.

<summary>How to Use</summary>

Press **V** (default keybind) to toggle night vision on or off.

To change the keybind, go to **Options → Controls → chrissi's Night Vision** and look for "Toggle Night Vision".

You can customize the mod's behavior by editing the config file located at:

```
config/chrissi-nightvision.json
```

**Note:** You need to restart Minecraft after changing the config file for changes to take effect.

**Mod Menu integration** may be considered for future updates, but for now, manual config editing keeps the mod lightweight and dependency-free.

<summary>Server Usage & Legality</summary>

⚠️ **Use at your own risk!**

This mod should generally be allowed on most servers, as it only provides the vanilla night vision effect. However, some servers may explicitly ban gamma mods or similar brightness modifications. Always check the server rules before using.
