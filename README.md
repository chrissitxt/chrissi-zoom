<summary>How to Use</summary>

Hold **C** (default keybind) to zoom in. While zooming, use your **mouse wheel** to adjust the zoom level.

To change the keybind, go to **Options → Controls → Miscellaneous** and look for "Hold Zoom".

**Mod Menu integration** may be considered for future updates, but for now, manual config editing keeps the mod lightweight and dependency-free.
